## THEME
Due to the phone ban at Stuyvesant, the seniors have formed a fighting / illegal gambling ring where they bet on the result of "battles" between freshmen.
Your goal is to become the #1 freshman trainer by defeating all other seniors.

##  Adventurer + Boss Ideas
# Adventurers:
- Brooklyn Tech freshman (DEFAULT): Everything should be balanced around this kid, standard attack, special is just the attack but slightly more dmg, support just heals.
- Kid with a pet tarantula: This is a kid with a pet tarantula, maybe some stunning ability w/ low dmg normally idk.
- Sick child: Lower health + dmg, slightly "poisons" all other enemies though + maybe "thorns" whenever attacked.
- Popular kid: Can "summmon" friends, other stats are slightly nerfed from DEFAULT, becomes washed up if knocked out though.
> Washed up child: Is what the popular kid becomes if he gets knocked out, slightly lowered stats from DEFAULT.

# Bosses:
- CHEATER: a senior participating in the "battles" himself, honestly just double all the stats of DEFAULT.
- Underpaied teacher: an underpaied teacher, can "summon" freshman by bribing them with cell phone access.
