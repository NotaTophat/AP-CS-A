# THEME
Due to the phone ban at Stuyvesant, the seniors have formed a fighting / illegal gambling ring where they bet on the result of "battles" between freshmen.
Your goal is to become the #1 freshman trainer by defeating all other seniors.

#  Adventurer + Boss Ideas
## Adventurers (if some seem too complex, they can just be removed):
- **Brooklyn Tech freshman** (*DEFAULT*): Everything should be balanced around this kid, standard attack, special is just the attack but slightly more dmg, support just heals.
- **Kid with a pet tarantula**: This is a kid with a pet tarantula, maybe some stunning ability w/ low dmg normally idk.
- **Sick child**: Lower health + dmg, slightly "poisons" all other enemies though + maybe "thorns" whenever attacked.
- **Popular kid**: Can "summmon" friends, other stats are slightly nerfed from *DEFAULT*, becomes washed up if knocked out though.
- *Washed up child*: Is what the *popular* kid becomes if he gets knocked out, slightly lowered stats from *DEFAULT*, cannot purchase directly.
- **baby**: always spawns with a plastic knife. No one is willing to attack it *directly*. The baby WILL trip and fall whenever it attacks though, eventually knocking itself out. 
- **sleep deprived kid**: chance to pass out every other turn, special makes them drink like 15 energy drinks, temporarilly tripling their dammage for like 5 turns before they pass out.
- **caffine addicted kid**: can caffinate other freshman and itself, full restoring special, health, and unstunning them.
- **"rich" freshman**: "rich" as in "has fifty bucks". If you lose a match you WILL be able to pocket those fifty bucks. The ammount it currently has constantly increases by like 10 / battle it has been in and 5 / round, it special gives you 1 dollar, otherwise abilities are the same.

## Bosses:
- **CHEATER**: a senior participating in the "battles" himself, honestly just double all the stats of *DEFAULT*.
- **Underpaied teacher**: an underpaied teacher, can "summon" freshman by bribing them with cell phone access. 

- (FINAL BOSS?): You gain access to your entire "bank" of freshman, and you must stall for as long as possible. Your final score is determined by how long you are able to stall for.

# Gameplay cycles between the battle phases (described above), and one rest phase, the game generally ramps up in difficulty, with more freshman and more difficult freshman being added, bosses ~ every 5 cycles.

## Rest
During rest you can:
- "Purchase" freshman from the senior bar (you are given a list of the ones 'on stock', these change between rest cycles)
- Bet on the result of different battles (auto battles, you are shown the teams before-hand and can bet on their results)
- Interact with a "bank" and switch your current team of freshmen to a different one.

# OPTIONAL IF THERE IS MORE TIME, THEY ARE TO BE ADDED IN DECENDING ORDER:
- **Randomness?**:Simple stuff like names, heath, shiny freshmen.
- **Timing minigame??**: we animate the thingy during the attack and do stuff based on player input.
- **Sprite system**: Sprites stored in files, which can be decoded int 2d arrays and then printed in the screen
- **Background??**: just a background to the terminal OR to put the sprites on if we add them
- **Items somehow????**
